I am a second year PhD student in the [Computational Intelligence group](https://cs.vu.nl/ci/) at the [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/nl) in collaboration with [Technology Innovation Institute (TII)](https://www.tii.ae/), under supervision of [Guszti Eiben](https://www.cs.vu.nl/~gusz/) and [Eliseo Ferrante](https://cs.vu.nl/ci/index.php/dr-eliseo-ferrante/). 

The topic of my PhD is the development of learning algorithms for evolvable legged robots (here body and brain are subject to evolution) in dynamic environments. I mainly work in Python and C++ as part of a team where we develop an ER software package called [Revolve](https://ci-group.github.io/revolve2/installation/index.html) that wraps around different simulators (MuJoCo, Gazebo, Isaac Gym) for robot evolution experiments. Here, I develop controllers for robots that learn motor skills from scratch (using Differential Neural Networks). The ER context of my PhD produces interesting challenges regarding embodied intelligence, model agnostic learning, and adaptive control.

Background
======
I graduated in 2020 with two master degrees: Human Movement Science (with predicate _cum laude_ Vrije Universiteit Amserdam) and Mechanical Engineering (Technische Universiteit Delft). During my study Human Movement Science (for which I also obtained my BSc.) I specialised on human motor control and neuromechanics. In Mechanical Engineering I specialised on the topic of bio-robotics. I obtained both my master nominally in parallel.

Research Interest
======
In general, I like to combine ideas from different fields and/or nature to solve hard probems. Topics of interests are: self-modelling, embodied intelligence, complex systems, adaptive control. I believe that current machine learning applications in robotics could benefit a lot from a control theoretic framework. For example, physics informed domains, geometric priors, in/equivariance properties, and differential modelling. Currently, I am mostly interested in using machine learning techniques for data-driven modelling of complex systems in robotic control.
