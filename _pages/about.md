My nam is Fuda van Diggelen, and I am a second year PhD student in the [Computational Intelligence group](https://cs.vu.nl/ci/){:target="_blank"} at the [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/nl){:target="_blank"}.
My project is in collaboration with [Technology Innovation Institute (TII)](https://www.tii.ae/){:target="_blank"}, and supervised by [Guszti Eiben](https://www.cs.vu.nl/~gusz/){:target="_blank"} and [Eliseo Ferrante](https://cs.vu.nl/ci/index.php/dr-eliseo-ferrante/){:target="_blank"}. 

The topic of my PhD is the development of learning algorithms for evolvable legged robots --where we evolve both body and brain-- in dynamic environments. 
The Evolutionary Robotucs (ER) context of my PhD provides several interesting challenges regarding embodied intelligence, model agnostic learning, and adaptive control.
I mainly work in Python and C++ as part of a team that develops a software package called [Revolve](https://ci-group.github.io/revolve2/installation/index.html){:target="_blank"} which is a wrapper for robot evolution experiments around different simulators (MuJoCo, Gazebo, Isaac Gym). 
Within this framework, I develop controllers for robots that learn motor skills from scratch using Differential Neural Networks. 

Background
======
I graduated in 2020 with two master degrees: Human Movement Science (with predicate _cum laude_ Vrije Universiteit Amserdam) and Mechanical Engineering (Technische Universiteit Delft). 
Both masters were obtained in nominally in parallel.
For my study Human Movement Science (in which I also obtained my B.Sc. degree) I specialised in human motor control and neuromechanics. 
At TU Delft I specialised on the topic of bio-robotics and control theory. 

Research Interest
======
In general, I like to combine ideas from different fields and nature to solve hard probems in robotics. 
Topics of interests include: self-modelling, embodied intelligence, complex adaptive systems, and control theory. 
I believe that current machine learning applications in robotics could benefit a lot when using control theoretic principles. 
For example, leveraging physics informed domains, geometric priors, and equivariant properties provide additional frameworks for current models. 
Currently, I am mostly interested in the use of ML for data-driven modelling of complex systems in robotic control.
