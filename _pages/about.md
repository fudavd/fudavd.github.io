About me
======
I am a [Postdoctoral fellow](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Xn9iFKsAAAAJ){:target="_blank"} in the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems (LIS) under supervision of [Dario Floreano](https://people.epfl.ch/dario.floreano){:target="_blank"}, at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lis/){:target="_blank"}). 
My research interest lies on the intersection of robotics and AI, where I mainly focus on robot learning for emergent properties in swarms of robots.

Background
======
As a broadly educated scholar, I can bring a unique perspective by combining techniques from different fields to tackle challenging projects.
Throughout my education, my research focusses in understanding of embodied intelligence, complex systems, and control theory.


    My research focuses on the integration of machine learning with bio-inspired control for robots in unknown environments. Here I developed model agnostic controllers for complex adaptive systems, using data-driven modeling.
    My main interest lies in self-adaptive control systems.

I finished my PhD in 2024 on the topic of robot learning in Evolutionary Robotics, at the [Computational Intelligence group](https://cs.vu.nl/ci/){:target="_blank"}, [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/nl){:target="_blank"}, in support of Technology Innovation Institute ([TII](https://www.tii.ae/){:target="_blank"}), and supervised by [Guszti Eiben](https://www.cs.vu.nl/~gusz/){:target="_blank"} and [Eliseo Ferrante](https://cs.vu.nl/ci/index.php/dr-eliseo-ferrante/){:target="_blank"}). 
An evolving population of robots  --where both body and brain are optimized-- provides a challenging context regarding embodied intelligence, model agnostic learning, and adaptive control.
In 2020 I obtained two master degrees: Human Movement Science, neuromechanics (with predicate _cum laude_ Vrije Universiteit Amserdam) and Mechanical Engineering, bio-robotics (Technische Universiteit Delft). 


Selected Projects
======

Emergence of Specialised Collective Behaviors in Evolving Heterogeneous Swarms

Swarms of animal exhibit astonishing collective behaviours through coordinated collaboration, thereby elevating their capabilities as a whole, i.e. emergent capabilities. 
In this [paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-70068-2_4){:target="_blank"}, we leverage collective behaviors by evolving swarms with different behavioral repertoires.



A model-free method to learn multiple skills in parallel on modular robots

In nature, many newborn animals can walk within minutes of birth. This [Nature Communications](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50131-4){:target="_blank"} publication, draws inspiration from this phenomenon with a novel method that enables robots to learn locomotion in just 15 minutes.

The Dutch ICU Data Warehouse

During COVID-19, a Dutch national collaboration was established between universities, hospital ICUs, and industry. 
The [ICU data pipeline](https://github.com/AmsterdamUMC/AmsterdamUMCdb){:target="_blank"}, provided analysis tools, and several machine learning models to analyse and improve health care policies.

Revolve

    <img src="images/revolve_cut.png" alt="Description of the image" width="150" />
</div>

During my PhD, I mainly work in Python and C++ as part of a team that develops a software package called [Revolve](https://ci-group.github.io/revolve2/installation/index.html){:target="_blank"} which is a wrapper for robot evolution experiments around different simulators (MuJoCo, Gazebo, Isaac Gym). 
Within this framework, I develop controllers for robots that learn motor skills from scratch.
