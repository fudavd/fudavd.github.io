About me
======
I am a [Postdoctoral fellow](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Xn9iFKsAAAAJ){:target="_blank"} in the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems (LIS) under supervision of [Dario Floreano](https://people.epfl.ch/dario.floreano){:target="_blank"}, at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lis/){:target="_blank"}). 
My research interest lies on the intersection of robotics and AI, where I mainly focus on robot learning for emergent properties in swarms of robots.

Background
======
I graduated in 2020 with two master degrees: Human Movement Science (with predicate _cum laude_ Vrije Universiteit Amserdam) and Mechanical Engineering (Technische Universiteit Delft). 
Both masters were obtained in nominally in parallel.
For my study Human Movement Science (in which I also obtained my B.Sc. degree) I specialised in human motor control and neuromechanics. 
At TU Delft I specialised on the topic of bio-robotics and control theory. 

I finished my PhD in 2024 on the topic of robot learning in Evolutionary Robotics, at the [Computational Intelligence group](https://cs.vu.nl/ci/){:target="_blank"}, [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/nl){:target="_blank"}, in support of Technology Innovation Institute ([TII](https://www.tii.ae/){:target="_blank"}), and supervised by [Guszti Eiben](https://www.cs.vu.nl/~gusz/){:target="_blank"} and [Eliseo Ferrante](https://cs.vu.nl/ci/index.php/dr-eliseo-ferrante/){:target="_blank"}). 
An evolving population of robots  --where both body and brain are optimized-- provides a challenging context regarding embodied intelligence, model agnostic learning, and adaptive control.


Selected Projects
======

Emergence of Specialised Collective Behaviors in Evolving Heterogeneous Swarms

</div>

Swarms of animal exhibit astonishing collective behaviours through coordinated collaboration, thereby elevating their capabilities as a whole, i.e. emergent capabilities. 
In this [paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-70068-2_4){:target="_blank"}, we leverage collective behaviors by evolving swarms with different behavioral repertoires.



A model-free method to learn multiple skills in parallel on modular robots

In nature, many newborn animals can walk within minutes of birth. This [Nature Communications](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50131-4){:target="_blank"} publication, draws inspiration from this phenomenon with a novel method that enables robots to learn locomotion in just 15 minutes. 

The Dutch ICU Data Warehouse

</div>

During COVID-19, a Dutch national collaboration was established between universities, hospital ICUs, and industry. 
The [ICU data pipeline](https://github.com/AmsterdamUMC/AmsterdamUMCdb){:target="_blank"}, provided analysis tools, and several machine learning models to analyse and improve health care policies.

Revolve

    <img src="images/revolve_cut.png" alt="Description of the image" width="150" />
</div>

During my PhD, I mainly work in Python and C++ as part of a team that develops a software package called [Revolve](https://ci-group.github.io/revolve2/installation/index.html){:target="_blank"} which is a wrapper for robot evolution experiments around different simulators (MuJoCo, Gazebo, Isaac Gym). 
Within this framework, I develop controllers for robots that learn motor skills from scratch.
