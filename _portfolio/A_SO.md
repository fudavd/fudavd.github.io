De kennis van nu _special_: De robot evolutie 
-
Research done by the CI-group was covered in a special documentary by NPO (_Dutch national television_) on robot evolution. 
In this documentary, several researchers from different Dutch universities explains how AI can help robots become smarter. 
I was interviewed about my PhD on the application of evolutionary algorithm on real robots. Dutch only.
